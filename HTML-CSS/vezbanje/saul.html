        The Offices of Saul Goodman & Associates was where Saul Goodman,
        Attorney at Law, conducted most of his business. It is located in a
        strip mall in Albuquerque, New Mexico. On the outside there is a large
        sign with his slogan
        <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Better_Call_Saul"
          >"Better Call Saul!"</a
        >
        and an inflatable Statue of Liberty on the strip-mall's roof. On the
        inside is a waiting room, with Saul's secretary Francesca Liddy and
        later a large security guard named Huell Babineaux. Apparently he works
        with no other lawyers. Saul's strip-mall office contains many gaudy
        assurances of his law practice: his diploma from the University of
        American Samoa, an actual Scale of Justice on his desk, wallpaper of the
        U.S. Constitution, and white, plastic Ionian columns resembling those
        found on government buildings.

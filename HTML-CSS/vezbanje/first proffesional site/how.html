        <h2>1.You can buy ETH from exchanges or from wallets directly.</h2>
        <p>We will explain how to buy <b>ethereum</b> in a few steps.
        <ol>
          <li><b>Determine Your Level of Risk.</b> There's no getting around it; buying Ethereum can be a gamble.There’s no getting around it; buying Ethereum can be a gamble. While all investments have some risk associated with them, cryptocurrencies are especially vulnerable to price fluctuations. Just think about the impact a couple of hundred characters can have on crypto pricing: After Elon Musk tweeted that Tesla would no longer accept Bitcoin as payment, for instance, the coin’s value tumbled 15%.</li>
          <li><b>Choose a Crypto Exchange.</b> Buying Ether is a little more complicated than just buying stocks or mutual funds through your current brokerage account.A couple of key points: When choosing an exchange, make sure it offers a crypto wallet to store your investments. The vast majority do, but if yours doesn’t, you’ll need to get one of your own.</li>
          <li><b>Fund Your Account.</b>Before you can buy Ethereum through a crypto exchange, you have to fund your account. In most cases, you’ll deposit money from a bank account, like your personal checking or savings account. You can also generally complete wire transfers, use a debit card or deposit money via netbanking.When choosing a funding method, review the crypto exchange’s fees; they can vary based on the method. For example, wire transfers are free on CoinDCX, but the platform charges a 0.5% on net banking. </li>
          <li><b>Buy Ethereum.</b>To purchase Ethereum, enter its ticker symbol—ETH—in your exchange’s “buy” field and input the amount you want to buy. If you don’t want to buy a whole Ethereum token or don’t have enough money in your account for a full coin, you can purchase a fraction of one. For example, if the price of Ethereum is $2,000 and you invest $100, you will purchase 5% of an Ether coin. This is just like when you purchase a fractional share of a stock</li>
          <li><b>Store Your Ethereum.</b>After your purchase of Ethereum has been processed, you have to store your cryptocurrency. While some platforms will store it for you, some people opt to store their investments themselves to reduce the likelihood they will lose their crypto to a hack. This is understandable, but it’s also important to note that most major exchanges do insure their clients’ holdings and often store the majority of their assets offline to prevent massive theft. What’s more, historically exchanges that have been hacked have reimbursed any losses.</li>

        <h2>2.You can mine ETH using GPUs rigs.</h2>
        <p>We will explain how to mine <b>ethereum</b>    in a few steps.</p>
        <ol>
          <li><b>Choose your mining approach.</b>Mining Ethereum in a pool is the simplest and quickest way to get started. In pool mining, you join forces with other individuals. All the miners joining a pool agree that if one of them solves the cryptographic puzzles, rewards will be split among them according to the hashpower provided. The size of the pool, measured in hashpower, determines how many blocks the group finds on average.However, not all pools are created equal. When choosing a pool, three key characteristics should be considered: pool size, minimum payout, and pool fee. The pool fee specifies the share the pool administrator gets for running the pool. If a pool has higher fees than 3%, you may want to consider finding another pool. Minimum payout defines the smallest amount one can withdraw from the pool. For instance, if the minimum payout is 1 ether, it can take weeks or months until you reach the required amount in reward payments and can cash out.</li>
          <li><b>Create an Ethereum wallet.</b>In case you don’t already have an Ethereum wallet, you need to create one. There are many wallets available on the market. Two popular wallets are MetaMask and Trust Wallet.</li>
          <li><b>Prepare your hardware and software.</b>Mining requires lots of computing power. To efficiently mine ether, you need at least one powerful GPU unit. Several GPUs can also be connected to so-called mining ‘rigs.’ To ensure that your GPUs work as efficiently as possible, it is important to install the latest available updates provided by your GPU manufacturer AMD or Nvidia.</li>
          <li><b>Install Ethereum-mining software.</b>There are different types of ether-mining software. Go here to download the latest version of Claymore dual miner or find software you like. To set up Claymore dual miner, follow the step-by-step instructions provided in this Tutorial (point 3.3).</li>
          <li><b>Choose a mining pool.</b>While setting up your mining software, you will have to decide, which m ining pool you want to be a part of. There are many choices, e.g., 2Miners or Ethermine. Before settling for one, make sure to check the pool size, minimum payout, and the pool fee.</li>
          <li><b>Collect your rewards.</b>After having mined for some time, you can reap your earned mining rewards. Go to your pool’s webpage and copy/paste your public Ethereum wallet address into the search bar to get an overview of your mining rewards. Depending on the pool, you can either claim your rewards manually or have them automatically sent to your ether wallet when reaching the minimum payout level.</li>

        <h1>Forks of Ethereum</h1>
        <p>Ethereum has also changed since it was first launched. "When blockchain technology changes (or upgrades), a fork can occur — just like a fork in the road," says Farrington. "When this happens, it can be a soft fork or hard fork."In general, there are what's known as soft forks and hard forks in ethereum:

        <h1>Soft forks </h1>
        <p> -can be minor changes that are backward compatible. Node operators can stay connected to the blockchain, but they're incentives to upgrade to the latest version if they want to continue earning ether. </p>

        <i class="fa fa-code-fork" aria-hidden="true"></i>
        <h1>Hard forks</h1>
        <p>-are major upgrades that can significantly change the system and aren't backward compatible. Node operators need to switch to the latest version to keep the blockchain going. Or, if there's a disagreement, a split could result in two competing blockchains.</p>

        <h1>What is ethereum mining</h1>
        <p>Mining is the process of creating a block of transactions to be added to the Ethereum blockchain in Ethereum's now-deprecated.The word mining originates in the context of the gold analogy for cryptocurrencies.

        <h1>Why do miners exist </h1>
        <p>In decentralized systems like Ethereum, we need to ensure that everyone agrees on the order of transactions. Miners helped this happen by solving computationally difficult puzzles to produce blocks, securing the network from attacks.

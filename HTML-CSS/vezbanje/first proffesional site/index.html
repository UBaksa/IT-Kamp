        Ethereum isn't just for digital money. Anything you can own can be
        represented, traded and put to use as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). You
        can tokenise your art and get royalties automatically every time it's
        re-sold. Or use a token for something you own to take out a loan. The
        possibilities are growing all the time.

        Ethereum is a technology that's home to digital money, global payments,
        and applications. The community has built a booming digital economy,
        bold new ways for creators to earn online, and so much more. It's open
        to everyone, wherever you are in the world – all you need is the
        <b>internet.</b>

    <h3>Etherium Overview</h3>
      <div class="big big1">
        <p>The Ethereum software utilizes its own programming language called <b>Solidity.</b>
          That language is used create types of programs called smart contracts.
          Smart contracts and transactions done by those contracts are executed by “<b>the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)”</b> <small>(a machine that executes the code)</small> and stored on the Ethereum blockchain <small>(a database protocol for securely storing data)</small>.
          This computing system can be used to settle financial contracts like Bitcoin, but unlike Bitcoin it can also be used to create and host apps and more.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="big big2">
        <p>Ethereum is commonly used to create “tokens” like the native <b>Ether (ETH) and ICO tokens like KIN or ZRX,</b> to create and host <b>decentralized apps or DApps</b> <small>(apps with their backend hosted on the Ethereum platform)</small> like CryptoKitties and Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), to create <b>DAOs</b> (Democratic Autonomous Organizations; i.e. decentralized companies/groups), to <b>crowdfund</b> those ICOs and DAOs, and to store and execute <b>smart contracts</b> <small>(computer programs that execute when conditions are met)</small>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="big big3">
        <p>In other words, Ethereum does a lot more than just host the cryptocurrency everyone trades ETH. Where Bitcoin is like a decentralized and distributed mix between PayPal and an online bank account, Ethereum is like that plus an operating system / programming language… and thus there is a little more to explain here than there is with a more focused cryptocurrency like Bitcoin.
        <B>The Decentralized Web</B>: Many DAaps use websites for the front facing part that users interact with and the Ethereum network for the backend. Using websites to access DAaps is browsing the decentralized web. Check out <a target="_blank" href="https://metamask.io/">MetaMask</a> or <a target="_blank" href="https://www.coinbase.com/">Coinbase</a> Wallet for examples.</p>

        <p><b>Ethereum 2.0</b>: One problem Ethereum had in 2017 was speed. Luckily, Ethereum is software and software can be updated. The plan to take Ethereum to the next step can very generally be called <b>“Ethereum 2.0.”</b>
        ICO Drama Circa 2017 – 2018: ICOs got a bad reputation in 2017 – 2018 for a myriad of complex reasons <small>(mostly having to do with a lack of quality control in some cases and the SEC in other cases)</small>. However, in that messy process Ethereum clearly proved its core ability to act as a platform to create <b>DAO`s</b> build a coin networks, and crowfund many projects at a rapid pace. In simple terms, Ethereum worked, works, and is working.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="big big5">
        <p><i><b>SEMANTICS</b></i>: The key words here are “decentralized and distributed” <small>(which means hosted on many computers with no central controlling power)</small>, <b>“tokens”</b> <small>(which can represent a cryptocurrency or anything you can imagine a digital string of numbers and letters can represent )</small>, <b>“smart contracts”</b> <small>(digital contracts/programs which can do a wide range of things, including distribute coins or record transactions using blockchain technology)</small>, <b>“blockchain”</b> <small>(a secure, encrypted, and sequential digital record of “blocks” of data)</small>,<b> “DAO”</b> <small>(an organization bound by smart contracts rather than the enforcement of central figures)</small>.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="big big6">
        <p>The Peoples’ Decentralized World Computer <small>(An Ideal)</small>: Where Bitcoin and its blockchain are focused on creating and maintaining a record of a single cryptocurrency and its transactions, Ethereum is an open-source software platform based on blockchain technology that does much more than just house a cryptocurrency. Due to this, this page is a bit more in depth than other pages.
        <b>Ether Vs. Ethereum: “Ether,”</b> which trades under the symbol ETH, is the name for the cryptocurrency token native to Ethereum’s “blockchain-based smart contract platform” <small>(just like Bitcoin is the token native to what we could call Bitcoin’s “blockchain-based smart contract platform”)</small>. </p>

        Ethereum isn't just for digital money. Anything you can own can be
        represented, traded and put to use as non-fungible tokens (NFTs). You
        can tokenise your art and get royalties automatically every time it's
        re-sold. Or use a token for something you own to take out a loan. The
        possibilities are growing all the time.

        Ethereum is a technology that's home to digital money, global payments,
        and applications. The community has built a booming digital economy,
        bold new ways for creators to earn online, and so much more. It's open
        to everyone, wherever you are in the world – all you need is the
        <b>internet.</b>

    <h3>Etherium Overview</h3>
      <div class="big">
        <p>The Ethereum software utilizes its own programming language called <b>Solidity.</b>
          That language is used create types of programs called smart contracts.
          Smart contracts and transactions done by those contracts are executed by “<b>the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)”</b> <small>(a machine that executes the code)</small> and stored on the Ethereum blockchain <small>(a database protocol for securely storing data)</small>.
          This computing system can be used to settle financial contracts like Bitcoin, but unlike Bitcoin it can also be used to create and host apps and more.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="big big3">
        <p>Ethereum is commonly used to create “tokens” like the native <b>Ether (ETH) and ICO tokens like KIN or ZRX,</b> to create and host <b>decentralized apps or DApps</b> <small>(apps with their backend hosted on the Ethereum platform)</small> like CryptoKitties and Decentralized Exchanges (DEXs), to create <b>DAOs</b> (Democratic Autonomous Organizations; i.e. decentralized companies/groups), to <b>crowdfund</b> those ICOs and DAOs, and to store and execute <b>smart contracts</b> <small>(computer programs that execute when conditions are met)</small>.</p>
